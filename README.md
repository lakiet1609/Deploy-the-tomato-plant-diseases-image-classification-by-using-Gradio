# Deploy-the-tomato-plant-diseases-image-classification
This repository is deep learning model. The code includes end to end image classification model using Pytorch and developing the interface
- The link of the dataset is from kaggle you can download here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset
- The tomato_plants folder is used for deploy the model by using Gradio to the Hugging Face resources to classify the object !!!!!
- The remain files are the progress of preprocessing, building, training data to get the 90% accuracy model 
- You can download a pretrained model from tag
